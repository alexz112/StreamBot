Thanks for using my **StreamBot** if you need any help feel free to contact me!
## <a name="0"></a>Proxy
To use this bot you need proxies. You can download mine but you can use your own too!
Get mine from: https://bit.ly/sb_proxies
## <a name="0"></a>How to use
**Easy way to configure it: https://youtu.be/MyrM8_ZL3s4**
Run the "StreamBot" as administrator. Get the video id (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v + id, ex: MyrM8_ZL3s4). Select a proxy type [HTTPS,SOCKS4,SOCKS5]. Wait until a window with "Open" pops up and then select your proxies. (Only one file). Enjoy it!
## <a name="0"></a>More information
You can't get instant views if you have bad proxies. You can contact me on discord if you have a app problem not if your proxies are bad or anything like that.
(WARNING!) If you boost someone that doesn't means he will be in the top #1 recomandations at livestreams.
